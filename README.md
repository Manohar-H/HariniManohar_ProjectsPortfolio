##  Hello, I'm Harini Manohar 👋
### Welcome to my project portfolio!  

I'm a software development student with a background in healthcare and administration, now focused on building thoughtful, real-world applications through code. This repository serves as a central hub for the major projects I've worked on since I began my tech journey — from foundational logic building to full-stack applications using **React**, **Node.js**, **Java**, and **Python**.

Each project represents a step forward in my learning — solving real problems, experimenting with tools, and continuously improving through feedback and hands-on practice. Whether you're an employer, mentor, or fellow learner, I invite you to explore the work, the process, and the potential.
